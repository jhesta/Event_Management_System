                        A wine tour is one such classy experience of course for wine lovers, but also for anybody who is here just for the fun of it. 
						This is an entire tour in itself and takes up about 60 minutes. It commences at around 10.30 AM.

Initially, guests are informed about the history of wine and its cultivation before heading to the vineyard. This is a fun yet knowledgeable event. 
It’s quite interesting to witness these procedures and understand the know-how behind the scenes. 
Every portion of the wine-making is discussed, ranging from fermentation to the procedures of bottling and finally the labeling. 
Undoubtedly the most awaited part of this tour is the event of wine tasting.

Here guests can sample up to six different varieties of wines, out of which two are of Indian origin and the rest are authentic French. 
When you indulge in this experience you come out as a wine connoisseur at the end of it. This event can be attended anytime between 10:30 AM to 4:00 PM.

Also, do keep in mind that this tour is not accessible for children. There is a minimum entry charge for the vineyard with all applicable taxes. 
The weather sometimes is unpredictable, so it is always safe to carry a jacket with you. 
Added fact is the delicious lunch available in the in-house restaurant. It’s worth going here and is one the most popular events in Bangalore.

                        A way to excite a boring weekend is by going for the enthralling safari experience in the gorgeous villages of Jakkur.  
	This tour takes you exploring the authentic old-fashioned tiny villages, rudimentary bazaars and the untouched wilderness of the surrounding woods.
There is no experience in comparison to that of riding on a horseback, 
cutting through the wind; you feel the magnanimous control over your life while you’re freely galloping through the meandering lanes.
Witnessing the beautiful sunrise while horse riding is an added feather to the cap. 
Interacting with the locals and learning about their lifestyle is simply nice. This tour ends with a lip smacking breakfast at the famous local restaurant.

Bangalore’s biggest and most happening flea market is Sunday Soul Sante. 
As the name suggests this flea market takes place on Sundays of particular month. 
It’s an expansive ground, flooded with stalls ranging from clothes, food stalls, art stuff and much more.
It easily takes an entire day to have a look around the place. Accompanying the flea market are the energetic performances by bands. 
This flea market is a beautiful event in Bangalore, which simply cannot be missed out on.
Some of the stalls here sell such unique stuff that you’re definitely not going to get in any other part of Bangalore

it’s nothing less than a paradise. Must visit!

Who hasn’t heard about the infamous Sunburn Festival?  This festival is a chief of EDM (electronic dance music). 
Its most popular and happening event takes place in Goa which takes place in December. 
But before that they have their large gigs in some of the biggest cities in India, one of them being Bangalore. 
A crowd of nothing less than 10,000 show up for this event.
The event consists of a line of artists, with some of the most popular international artists being a part of it. 
The music is loud, beer is loaded, and people are in full swings. There is so much energy in the air, and people exhibit utmost zeal.
In Bangalore, there are ideally just a couple of locations where Sunburn takes place as only these places can accommodate such a huge crowd. 
Music is never a disappointment. One can simply enter into its trance and refuse to come out. 
Some of the most famous artists are Hardwell, Martin Garrix, David Guetta, and Dmitri Vegas.

The Anthargange trek is one of the most coveted trekking spots near Bangalore. 
It's a unique confluence of trekking and cave exploration that takes the excitement one notch up. 
Anthargange hill is completely surrounded by boulders. Located around 65km from Bangalore near Kolar, 
the elevation of the top of this hill is 1712m above sea level. Anthargange Sunrise Trip is an unforgettable experience in terms of 
trekking and cave exploration. The trek which is around 3km in length, you will find it to be pretty moderate as the trek starts with 
finding a way through broken rocks and tricky path in the boulders to finally arrive at the cave site to explore. 
This amazing experience of making your way through the formation and crawling at times because of the cave's volcanic rock 
formation is a tale that will become everyone's point of envy.
The experience at Anthargange cave takes you back to prehistoric times, where you finally could be a "Cave Man". 
Unwind by the bonfire and let the magic of early dusk hours captivate you. All the efforts and wait pays off right after the completion of the trek 
when you get to witness the mesmerizing sunrise from atop the mountain. And, if luck favors, you might catch a glimpse of some wild animals around. 
As the dusk fades away, make your way back through the cave to the base.
